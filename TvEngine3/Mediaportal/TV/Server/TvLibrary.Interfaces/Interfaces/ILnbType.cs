    /// bandstacked LNBs are not able to receive as wide a frequency range as a regular LNB. This is due to the
    /// fact that the LNB shifts the frequencies of each transponder in such a way that they don't overlap...
    /// but this requires the use of bandwidth that would otherwise be used for receiving other transponders.

    /// The spreading makes it significantly easier to receive signals from a large number of satellites with just
    /// one satellite dish. The signal is slightly weakened by the second reflector, and the signal polarisation
    /// is also inverted. For circularly polarised signals, the inversion completely reverses the polarity; for
    /// linearly polarised signals it doesn't particularly matter.
